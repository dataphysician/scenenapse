Welcome to Scene Naps Studio. We're

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,140
solving a real problem in text-to-image

3
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:10,699
generation. Prompts are messy,

4
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:12,960
unstructured, and when the image doesn't

5
00:00:13,039 --> 00:00:15,079
match what you pictured, you usually have

6
00:00:15,159 --> 00:00:18,159
no idea what went wrong or what to change.

7
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:20,440
Scene Naps fixes this with a simple

8
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,899
two-phase pipeline. Phase 1 is prompt

9
00:00:23,959 --> 00:00:26,760
enhancement. You start with a plain prompt

10
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:29,199
like, "A woman walking through a neon

11
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:33,060
city at night." Our DSPy pipeline breaks

12
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:35,319
that single sentence into four clear

13
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:38,659
parts, elements, meaning who or what is in

14
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:40,940
the scene, objects, meaning what they

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,479
look like and what's present, actions,

16
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:45,180
meaning what's happening, and

17
00:00:45,279 --> 00:00:47,839
cinematography, meaning the camera angle,

18
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,299
lighting, composition, and mood. Each

19
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:53,879
composable element stays in its own lane,

20
00:00:53,939 --> 00:00:56,560
so every detail is clearly labeled, easy

21
00:00:56,599 --> 00:00:58,799
to edit, and never spills into the wrong

22
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:02,000
part of the prompt. Phase 2 is generation

23
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:04,459
and validation. We generate multiple

24
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:06,319
images using Nano Banana Pro.

25
00:01:07,139 --> 00:01:09,819
Each result is scored by Joy Quality, a

26
00:01:09,919 --> 00:01:12,739
fine-tuned SIGlib2 encoder model trained

27
00:01:12,779 --> 00:01:15,179
on pairwise preference, which ranks both

28
00:01:15,239 --> 00:01:18,599
aesthetic appeal and technical quality.

29
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,859
Then our VLM guardrails checks that the

30
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:23,499
image actually aligns with the prompt and

31
00:01:23,559 --> 00:01:25,979
matches what you asked for. And here's the

32
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,139
best part. If you wanna change a

33
00:01:28,199 --> 00:01:30,559
particular component, like make it golden

34
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:32,679
hour lighting, we only regenerate the

35
00:01:32,739 --> 00:01:34,860
cinematography part. That makes

36
00:01:34,919 --> 00:01:38,519
refinements fast, cheap, and predictable.

37
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:40,859
We also integrated Freepik semantic search

38
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:43,119
for reference images, and you can control

39
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:45,199
the entire workflow with your voice using

40
00:01:45,339 --> 00:01:49,559
Gemini's live API. Scene Naps, composable

41
00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:52,459
prompts, validated generations, and real

42
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,379
control over your creative vision. Thank

43
00:01:55,399 --> 00:01:55,779
you.
