00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:02,379 [Speaker 0]
Three, two, one.

00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:05,959 [Speaker 0]
Welcome to Scene Naps Studio. We're

00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,140 [Speaker 0]
solving a real problem in text-to-image

00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:10,699 [Speaker 0]
generation. Prompts are messy,

00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:12,960 [Speaker 0]
unstructured, and when the image doesn't

00:00:13,039 --> 00:00:15,079 [Speaker 0]
match what you pictured, you usually have

00:00:15,159 --> 00:00:18,159 [Speaker 0]
no idea what went wrong or what to change.

00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:20,440 [Speaker 0]
Scene Naps fixes this with a simple

00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,899 [Speaker 0]
two-phase pipeline. Phase 1 is prompt

00:00:23,959 --> 00:00:26,760 [Speaker 0]
enhancement. You start with a plain prompt

00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:29,199 [Speaker 0]
like, "A woman walking through a neon

00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:33,060 [Speaker 0]
city at night." Our DSPy pipeline breaks

00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:35,319 [Speaker 0]
that single sentence into four clear

00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:38,659 [Speaker 0]
parts, elements, meaning who or what is in

00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:40,940 [Speaker 0]
the scene, objects, meaning what they

00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,479 [Speaker 0]
look like and what's present, actions,

00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:45,180 [Speaker 0]
meaning what's happening, and

00:00:45,279 --> 00:00:47,839 [Speaker 0]
cinematography, meaning the camera angle,

00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,299 [Speaker 0]
lighting, composition, and mood. Each

00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:53,879 [Speaker 0]
composable element stays in its own lane,

00:00:53,939 --> 00:00:56,560 [Speaker 0]
so every detail is clearly labeled, easy

00:00:56,599 --> 00:00:58,799 [Speaker 0]
to edit, and never spills into the wrong

00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:02,000 [Speaker 0]
part of the prompt. Phase 2 is generation

00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:04,459 [Speaker 0]
and validation. We generate multiple

00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:06,319 [Speaker 0]
images using Nano Banana Pro.

00:01:07,139 --> 00:01:09,819 [Speaker 0]
Each result is scored by Joy Quality, a

00:01:09,919 --> 00:01:12,739 [Speaker 0]
fine-tuned SIGlib2 encoder model trained

00:01:12,779 --> 00:01:15,179 [Speaker 0]
on pairwise preference, which ranks both

00:01:15,239 --> 00:01:18,599 [Speaker 0]
aesthetic appeal and technical quality.

00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,859 [Speaker 0]
Then our VLM guardrails checks that the

00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:23,499 [Speaker 0]
image actually aligns with the prompt and

00:01:23,559 --> 00:01:25,979 [Speaker 0]
matches what you asked for. And here's the

00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,139 [Speaker 0]
best part. If you wanna change a

00:01:28,199 --> 00:01:30,559 [Speaker 0]
particular component, like make it golden

00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:32,679 [Speaker 0]
hour lighting, we only regenerate the

00:01:32,739 --> 00:01:34,860 [Speaker 0]
cinematography part. That makes

00:01:34,919 --> 00:01:38,519 [Speaker 0]
refinements fast, cheap, and predictable.

00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:40,859 [Speaker 0]
We also integrated Freepik semantic search

00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:43,119 [Speaker 0]
for reference images, and you can control

00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:45,199 [Speaker 0]
the entire workflow with your voice using

00:01:45,339 --> 00:01:49,559 [Speaker 0]
Gemini's live API. Scene Naps, composable

00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:52,459 [Speaker 0]
prompts, validated generations, and real

00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,379 [Speaker 0]
control over your creative vision. Thank

00:01:55,399 --> 00:01:55,779 [Speaker 0]
you.
